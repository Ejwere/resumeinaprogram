A set piece so i can get a programming job. If I send you this, please hire me. If you stumbled upon this by accident, feel free to leave a comment of encouragement or something.

I will try to implement as many languages as possible, they will have their own programs. 

Current list of programs:
Java
C++
HTML/CSS (yes, those are 2 languages technically. bite my shiny metal rear-end)
